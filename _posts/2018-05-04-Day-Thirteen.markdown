# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 12: May 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about React Router which has been changed to Browser Router and I Implemented Switch, I added Styled Components to the project to see how this works and then compared it to styles in React.

Other things I implemented or Learned: -

Working on one component at at time.

Started to commit to git more often once I make a changed and its working.

Also learned about Navlink and fixed an issue with the npm compile.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot today in regards to react, the Navlink and Browser router were really easy to implement, I seem to have got used to how components work within react although I need to learn how to manipulate the nav links.

**Links to work:**
