# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 38: June 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I decided that I would work on a ToDo List today, I began building the basics of the page with the input box and the add/remove buttons, I then added some of the core functionality inside react I eventually left the project bugged but displaying things to the console.

I really did not bother with the styling of the project as I wanted the core functionality to be working rather than spending too much time with styles which I can do after it was working.


**Thoughts:** I struggled with elements of this and had to do some searching to try and get it working which eventually paid off after awhile. Also for this project I worked offline.
