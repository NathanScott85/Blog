# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 37: June 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today was a rather different day, I ended up traveling to a Code Up event in Manchester which I had signed up for a few weeks prior, whilst at this event I ended up helping soe one who was completely new to creating anything development wise.

A bit later in the session I spoke with a Developer who had done some react, he sat and talked me through the a to do list and he made it look so easy. ='(

**Thoughts:** This was another enjoyable session and it was actually fun to help some one else learn and show them some of the stuff that I actually know, although for actually teaching someone I do believe I need more practice.

**Links to work:**

No links to work today due to attending Code Up Manchester.
