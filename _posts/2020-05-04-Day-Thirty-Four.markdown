# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 34: June 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: There is not a lot to write about today I went back onto free code camp and worked through the following sections: -

    1. Applied Visual Design
    2. applied accessibility

I eventually got to Responsive Web Design Principles where I stopped for the day.

**Thoughts:** Even though the Free code camp short problems are generally quick once you solve them, I actually found that they do consume a lot more time but then again it is time well spent.

**Links to work:**
No Links to work today.
