# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 7: May 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: The progress I made today was not as much as I would of liked I had other things that required my attention but managed to get the new project set up and on Github without no issues coming from that,I decided to go with trying to recreate the twitter log in page from tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I actually did not do as much as I would of liked today but I am happy that from the project set up I had no issues with github and I will probably have problems after saying this but I seem to have gotten used to commiting files and creating projects then pushing everything I have made to github.
