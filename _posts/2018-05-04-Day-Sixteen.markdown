# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 16: May 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I was out today but attending an event for Free Code Camp in my area which was actually fun to be around others with the interest in coding, I ended up learning a few things from others around me such as using flex box and also fixing the issues I had with the way my site was been displayed.

I also got given a recommended course on Udemy for a complete front end development course which I will purchase once I find the appropriate finance to pay for it.

**Thoughts:** Another productive day today when programming I loved the whole coding with others around me and I got to drink coffee whilst I was at it as well so no different from any other day for me, as for the react-learning project it is turning out to be more a portfolio as well as learning react at the same time.

No work done on the Udemy Course by Max today, I will have a go at some tomorrow and then do some more work on the project.
