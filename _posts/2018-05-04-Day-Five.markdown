# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 3: May 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I spent today working on the CSS and images for the top corner and sorting out issues  with Bootstrap, there are some issues still remaining but I made progress onceI had the the correct size images for the top left.

**Thoughts:** I am finding that when something goes wrong with the CSS that I have to completely remove all css in one file then put it back again and this can become a bit tiresome, I did as I said make progress but in doing so I also messed up the location of the navbar which i had originally positioned correctlyto the right hand side.

I am hoping that I can get this finished tomorrow then start a new project next week so thatI can then implement something different, I did not do any video tutorial work outside of the 1 hour commitment but I fully intend to pick that up over the next coming week.
