# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 28: May 02, 2018

**Today's Progress**: There was a Free Code Camp meet up today, I looked into creating my own navbar without using bootstrap for most of the FCC session and had a look at another FCC members code who is also learning react which was interesting to read, I eventually tried implementing the information that I found during the day later that evening but ended up leaving it for the night

**Thoughts:** I decided that I would leave the it for today and then try again tomorrow as I was getting frustrated at my lack of understanding and related to the FCC been around others who are learning is a positive and helps to keep the motivation going.
