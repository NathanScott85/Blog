# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 9: May 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continued with my second project of recreating the Front-End of Twitter Log in Page, I changed from using forms to inputs and removed the formJS file and a few others as I was really overcomplicating things.

I hit a lot of brick walls today and ended up asking a question on stack overflow but before this I spent a lot of time actually trying to solve the problem, I will work on putting bootstrap into the actual project tomorrow althogh I think I should of done this first.

**Thoughts:** The over complication of some simple things is something that I need to work on and going forward this I would say is a big weakness but in general I am happy with the progress I have made today,a very long day I did a lot more than one hour again today which could another attribute to making things more complex than they need to be.
