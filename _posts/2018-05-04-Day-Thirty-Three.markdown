# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 34: June 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I spent my time today working on splitting the navbar into separate components which which actually took a lot more time than I had initially planned, I also learned about passing a different component into the index.js file.

      import React from 'react';
      import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
      import './index.css';
      import App from './Containers/App';
      import Home from './Components/Pages/Home';
      import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';
 
      ReactDOM.render(<Home />, document.getElementById('root'));
      registerServiceWorker();

**Thoughts:** This was a relatively stress free day since I was just working on a component, although since I started this I pushed the work after midnight I think I should at least give a working cut off point so that I can relax later at night.
