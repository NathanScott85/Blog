# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 19: May 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I am a day late with this post, I ended up working on my project on this day but made a huge mistake with how I handled the commits, I committed some files that I did not want and then later tried to remove them using the command line which backfired on me and resulted in all the work for that day been lost.

I did not work on any udemy tutorials today.

**Thoughts:** I really need to take my time when completing things and I still have the habit of completing loads of things and not committing changes right away, so this is now a priority when working as bad habits later will become my worst enemy.
