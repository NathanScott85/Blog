# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 21: May 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on getting the site looking the part today and adding in images from a website called pexels, I currently have the contact page linked within the navbar but I am thinking of later removing this or a link in the footer or I could actually add a contact form but I think the the ways I have linked are enough.

I worked on the advanced web developer boot camp by Colt Steele from udemy, I learned about Css: Hover, Active and Focus which helped with my button on the navigation bar today making it look different when it is selected.

**Thoughts:** I think the actual projects looks awesome and the most important part I am getting to know more CSS which is really good, I took my time a lot more with this project and actually learned a lot more now that I am not rushing or pushing myself so hard.
