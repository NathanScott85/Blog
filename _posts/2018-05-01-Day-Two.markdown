# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: May 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: So for today I went with the things I had talked about yesterday and kept my focus on the udemy course on react and then later worked on my project of recreating the google search page(Front end).

**Thoughts:** The first part of the work was lot of watching video's related to the Udemy course and using jsbin until a bit later where you actually got to the React section of the tutorials I spent 1 or two hours on this, later in the day I decided to start the actual project, I got some of the basic components set up and then added some text but later removed this in favor of adding in some bootstrap, so I used npm to install Bootstrap into the project and eventually put a basic header and footer into the project.

I had some minor issues again with github but after some searching on the internet I found some commands that helped with the issue I was having in the terminal, other issues I was having was more related to css and trying to position text in a specific way. I will work more on this tomorrow to try and get the positioning fixed correctly.

Need to fix the footer to the bottom of the page and I think adding in a search bar in the middle will make it look a lot better than just having plain old text so I could do that tomorrow.
