# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 22: May 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I managed to get some small progress on the carousel today with changing the way the buttons at the bottom of the carousel worked, I tried many other things but ended up not getting the results I wanted.

**Thoughts:** I had so many issues with the carousel today, I eventually reverted it back to the bootstrap version, I am not so much putting this on hold but from tomorrow looking at starting a project in Javascript and learning some of that to progress in future projects as from a lot of searching I did today to fix the carousel, I could of just created my own in JS if I had more knowledge of it.

So from tomorrow I will push forward into the Js Section of the Advanced boot camp.

Also a side note took a break yesterday will do extra few days at end will end up been like 110 days of code.
