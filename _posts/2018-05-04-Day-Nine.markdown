# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 9: May 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on switching the website over to using react with props whilst still keeping some bootstrap elements, I worked on using states to store the names of each individual button then passing those names into the actual render method.

Small progress in the above, I went on to try and change the individual colors of each button which took up a lot of time the hour that I allocated to working on my actual project.

**Thoughts:** The implementation the states and props within react was rather simple to complete and I found I had more difficulty with the way the components work currently I am rendering the buttons as components from one file and this combined with bootstrap limits the colors to the same, so I need to either create a secondary component or figure out a way to change one button to the desired colors and border whilst maintaining the actual component in question.
