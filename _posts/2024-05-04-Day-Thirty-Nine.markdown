# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 39: June 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started today by working on an older project to fix some issues that it had, I changed the way I was using the CSS display property I went from using Inline-block to using display:flex which helped a huge amount there are still some issues like the navigation text, I also added margins into the actual project and changed the width and height to use pixels rather than percentage and auto.

I later moved onto working on the To Do List project for this I worked with a friend who talked me through some of the things I was having issues with and having him go through the problems I was facing really helped with my understanding of react.

**Thoughts:** After working on the To Do List project I thought about a project that takes an order from a person then stores that order in an array this could be a good way of practicing what I learned today, it was really good to be able to finish this project even though I had a small bit of help.

One additional side note is that I actually did not upload the work from yesterday and today on this To Do list project until today.
