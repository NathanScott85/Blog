## So What is Yes Theory?

I think to answer this question I have to start by talking about how I came accross this theory, I was sat one day as another other person would watching video's on YouTube and after watching the first video, although I cannot remember what the first video I watched was but I found it to be an inspiration.

So, The important question asked above, What is Yes Theory?

The most simple answer to that question is related to an interview by Will Smith who conducted an interview a few years ago about how a positive change can be made by just saying yes to things in life that you would normally say no to or hesitate to give a response.
