# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 26: May 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked through the bulk of the content on the udemy course by max again today, there is a small amount of this to finish up before the next section which works on an actual project, other than the actual udemy course I created a small project which had ony a navbar which was to test my knowledge.

**Thoughts:** 
When it got closer to the end of the day I ended up getting frustrated mainly due to the face that I was implementing things into the same project and that same project was just giving me an over view of how each part of react works, I eventually stopped for the night and decided I would come back to this later and from tomorrow work on the Burger Builder Project.
