# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 31: June 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I went and started the react section from the Advanced Web Developers BootCamp today, I am finding that learning from this is helping me to understand how props work within react, a lot of the work that I was doing today I have not pushed on to github so I have been working offline for most of the day, I will at some point move this to github but for now I will leave it offline as the stuff I learn from tutorials is better off shown in projects.

Here is a snippet of the code that started off my day today: -

          class Pet extends React.Component {
            render() {
              const style = {fontSize: '1.5em'};
              const Hobbies =["Sleeping", "Eating", "Cuddling"];
              return (
                <div className="card">
                <h2 className="name">Moxie</h2>
                <img src="https://github.com/tigarcia/Moxie/raw/master/moxie.png" alt="Moxie"/>

                <h5 style={{fontSize:'2em', margin: '2px'}}> Hobbies:</h5>

                <HobbyList/>
                </div>
              );
            }
          }
  
 

**Thoughts:** I am overall positive about todays learning session as I write this I am starting to slowly grasp props and how they work with the passing of information and even slowly getting to grips with the spread operator, I will reset my code in my project tomorrow and implement what I have learned about props and information into the project that I decided to work on in react but I will also not neglect the tutorials as this is a fundamental part of how I learn react.
