# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 29: June 03, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started later in the afternoon today looking at different information related to Navbar's to continue where I left off from the previous day, I eventually decided that I would start a mini project related to national parks and from this I went on to set up  the react project using create-react-app, I started implementing the components based upon what I had learned by breaking down each part into smaller components.

Once this had been completed I added styled components to my project using npm install, I then did a small amount of searching and found a NavIcon and I went about tying to implement this into react from a code pen.

**Thoughts:** Today was interesting as I actually managed to implement something from someone else whilst also understanding the code I was implementing, I also learned about react-motion package which was interesting and this was something that I had to implement into the project.
