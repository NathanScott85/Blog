# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 36: June 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Free Code camp website today as I thought it would be good to reach one of the projects on the actual website but prior to reaching the projects I had to complete the Responsive Web Design Principles, I eventually reached the build a tribute page where I went on to complete it in around two hours and I also worked on my tribute page passing the tests that were set for the project.

**Thoughts:** I found that some of the css problems had me thinking but where not actually that difficult, I rather enjoyed the creation of the tribute page regardless of the content links to the page are below: -
