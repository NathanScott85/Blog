# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 3: May 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started today on my project of recreating google search page, I spent most of my time adding in different elements and working with them to get them in the correct position.

A lot of my time was used on trying to find out how some things were positioned using CSS and this meant a lot of searching on google, so for today I did 1h 30min estimate.

I did not spend any time on the tutorial that I had been working on over the last two days wanted to see some progress on the actual project I mentioned above.

**Thoughts:** The main issues from today were mainly working with CSS and I think this attributes to my lack of understanding on which specific CSS code I should be using for a specific job like for example when working on the footer and trying to split the text at the bottom of the page so I have 3 words either side left and right eventually though after some effort and a bit of searching I managed to get a temporary solution to the problem.

Other issues I am having is getting the form to be in the center of the page, although the buttons are in the correct place for now below the form I see this as giving me a lot of issues in the near future but will deal with that when the time comes.
