# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 11: May 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I changed the way sections of the text appeared on the screen, it was more project clean up and make it look like the actual website. A lot of my progress was made when moving the actual text around keeping the alignments whilst using Margin-top for example.

**Thoughts:** I am finding an improvement in the whole way I work by just keeping focus to fixing one thing, I am also thinking I need to go back to basics when creating a project and just using basic text then working from there, I think from here I can then focus more on using react and gaining knowledge on the fundamentals.
