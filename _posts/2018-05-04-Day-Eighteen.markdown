# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 18: May 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: The progress for today was spent adding more styling to each page so that I can decide on how I want the project to look, The use of styled components has really helped me gain a grasp of how each component is displayed on screen and the Css learning is a lot better than when I first started as I found it a bit frustrating.

I did not work on any udemy tutorials today.

**Thoughts:** I need to fully decide on how I want the site to look as of now its using darker colors with the main home page having a background image.
