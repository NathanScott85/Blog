# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 6: May 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Todays time was spent with fixing issues with the search bar so that it would remain at the centre and correct size, I also had to deal with some of the responsiveness of the page today which helped a lot, the search bar is where I want it and the same goes for the right top images.

**Thoughts:** I Need to spend some time learning about media querys but I think for this project I will leave it without them as I would rather like to get used to how bootstrap works and I think for a future mini project work on a fully responsive nav bar to learn how those work properly with the google project I had the images loaded properly and the correct size but when using asmaller screen the images would revert back to default size.

The learning for today was bootstrap responsiveness and search boxes.
