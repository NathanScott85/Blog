# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 20: May 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: The progress I made today was brilliant, I managed to get a fully functioning navbar, I implemented a carousel and worked on getting media query's into my site so that it is responsive, I further changed the site to use more styled components such as the headers. The carousel still needs some work but thats for a later date.

For further information on the changes made check out the link below.

I did not work on any udemy tutorials today.

**Thoughts:** I made up for the mistakes of yesterday and gained some actual progress by having actual bootstrap elements in the website, which has been on my mind for a few days now it was either implement bootstrap or use the css grid system which is also something that I need to learn.
