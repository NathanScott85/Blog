# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 20: May 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: The progress I made today was brilliant, I managed to get a fully functioning navbar
I did not work on any udemy tutorials today.

**Thoughts:** I really need to take my time when completing things and I still have the habit of completing loads of things and not committing changes right away, so this is now a priority when working as bad habits later will become my worst enemy.
