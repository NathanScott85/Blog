# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 39: June 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on free code camp today I managed to work through some of the Java section from Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator to Assignment with a Returned Value. I had to keep working through a head ache for most of the day but still keep pushing through.

**Thoughts:** The Concatenating Strings section on FCC got me thinking for awhile but I worked out the answer eventually, I think tomorrow I will work on the National Parks website and add more content to that.

**Links to work:**
