# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 24: May 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
I worked on a huge chunk of the Advanced Web Developer boot camp course yesterday, there was a few coding exercises that I worked through and a lot of information to take on board: -

     1. Object Enhancements
     2. Object Enhancements: Quiz
     3. Object Destructuring
     4. Array Destructuring
     5. Introduction to the class Keyword
     6. Instance Methods
     7. Class Methods
     8. Coding Exercise: Class Keyword

I worked on a lot of the above and a few other coding exercises which I spent approximately 5-8 hours working through the video's and the exercises.

**Thoughts:** 
During the time I spent today I worked through a lot of topics some of it I already had a firm understanding and others I generally did not fully understand so I will have to work through the video's again at some point and put those things into practice.

**Links to work:**
No project work today.
