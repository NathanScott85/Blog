# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 11: May 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Input forms today ensuring that the position was correct and the log in button was also positioned correctly, small progress on the actual project which I much prefer to the previous days.

**Thoughts:** I spent my time today actually focusing on one thing and I started writing down the problems that I can currently see on the website which has helped me focus on one specific task, also taking a break from the previous days of starting 100DaysOfCode has helped with my focus and I am not pushing myself as hard.
