# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 14: May 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started today by working on the Udemy course work, I linked a picture of the commits below, i eventually got to the point of where I am on the second assignment set by the Course trainer.

In regards to the actual project of learning react so far it is going well, I started using ![ Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api) to change how the project looks.

**Thoughts:** I have a few issues that I need to work on such as fixing the way the image is currently displayed right now its just loaded in but I would like it to be loaded from styled components, I much prefer Styled Components to using the standard css or using React Styling as React inline styles can be very cluttered in one page.
